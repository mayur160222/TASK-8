– VPN Hands-On Practice (Using WARP VPN)
For this task, I explored how VPNs work using WARP by Cloudflare — a lightweight, fast, and privacy-focused VPN that integrates with the 1.1.1.1 DNS app. It’s super easy to use and great for privacy beginners.

Step-by-Step Process:-
1. Installing WARP VPN:-
I downloaded the 1.1.1.1 app with WARP from Cloudflare’s official website.

Installed it on my Windows laptop (you can also use it on Android/iOS).

The interface was simple — just a switch to turn it ON or OFF.

2. Connecting to WARP:-
I enabled WARP mode (not just DNS-only).

Within seconds, the connection was active.

The app showed “Connected using WARP” 

3. IP Address Check:-
Before enabling WARP: My IP showed my real location (India).

After enabling WARP: I visited whatismyipaddress.com — my IP address changed, showing a Cloudflare-assigned IP (not location-specific but obfuscated).
 IP successfully masked.

4. Browsing and Encryption Check:-
I browsed websites like Reddit, YouTube, and Google — no slowdown.

Traffic was encrypted, and I confirmed that DNS queries were routed via Cloudflare’s private DNS (1.1.1.1).

5. Disconnecting WARP:-
Turned it off via the toggle switch.

My original IP and regular DNS settings were restored instantly.

*What I Learned – WARP VPN Benefits:-

Hides IP address from websites and ISPs.

Secures DNS queries and encrypts internet traffic using modern protocols like WireGuard.

No setup headaches — just install and toggle.

Great speed — almost no drop in performance compared to regular VPN

* Limitations of WARP VPN:-

It doesn’t allow location spoofing — unlike traditional VPNs (you can’t choose country).

Not ideal for unblocking geo-restricted content like Netflix US.

Still need antivirus and browser security — VPN doesn’t stop phishing or keyloggers.
